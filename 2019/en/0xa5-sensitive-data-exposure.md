## Is the API Vulnerable?

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

### Scenario #2

Inspecting a mobile app traffic an attacker finds out that not all HTTP traffic
is performed on a secure protocol (TLS), namely profile images download. As user
interaction is binary, despite API traffic is performed on a secure protocol,
the attacker finds a pattern on API responses size which he uses to track user
preferences over the rendered content (profile images).
