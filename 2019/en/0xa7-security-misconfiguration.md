## Is the API Vulnerable?

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

### Scenario #2

To target a specific service, an attacker searches the API hostname on a popular
search engine of computers directly accessible from the Internet. A popular
database management system was running in such host, listening on the default
port. Because the default configuration has authentication disabled by default
and it was kept unchanged the attacker had access to millions of records with
PII, personal preferences and authentication data.
