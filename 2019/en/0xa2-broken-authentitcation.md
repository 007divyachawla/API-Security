## Is the API Vulnerable?

## Example Attack Scenarios

## Scenario #1

## Scenario #2

An attacker with access to a cloud-based team collaboration tool creates a
private channel with himself in it. Then he starts a call, sharing it in the
private channel: the HTTP request is recorded of later use. Two different users
start a call on a different channel. The attacker grabs the channel id,
replacing it in the previously captured HTTP request. Resending the request
enables attacker to eavesdrop the private call.
