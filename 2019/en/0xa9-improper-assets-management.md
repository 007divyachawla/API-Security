## Is the API Vulnerable?

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

After redesigning their apps, a local search service left an old API version
running, unprotected and with access to the user database
(`api.someservice.com/v1`). While targeting one of the latest released apps an
attacker got the API address (`api.someservice.com/v2`). Replacing `v2` by `v1`
in the url gave the attacker access to the old and unprotected API, exposing
over 100 Million userâ€™s personal identifiable information (PII).
