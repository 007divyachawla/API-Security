A3:2019 Improper Data Filtering
===============================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Access Lvl : Exploitability ? | Prevalence ? : Detectability ? | Technical ? : Business |
| Since API are used as data sources, many times while writing the APIs developers try to implement them in a very generic way, without thinking about the sensitivity of the exposed data. They rely on clients to perform the data filtering before showing it to the user. | | Frequently sensitive object properties are exposed such as those holding PII protected by law or regulation (e.g. GDPR), authentication data or meaningful resources relationships. |
